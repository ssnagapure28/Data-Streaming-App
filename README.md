# Data-Streaming-App
In this project, we're bringing data to life with a distributed system powered by Apache Kafka and Python. Inspired by Kris Jenkins' Coding in Motion series, weâ€™ll build a real-time video streaming solution that:

âœ… Streams video frames from a Python-based producer
âœ… Transmits those frames over a Kafka topic
âœ… Serves the video in a web browser using Flask and OpenCV
âœ… Demonstrates how streaming transforms static media into reactive experiences

ðŸ“¹ What Are We Building?
A Kafka-powered pipeline that:
Uses Python to read video data from a static file
Streams video frames into Kafka as serialized messages
Processes and consumes those messages to serve them in real-time
Displays the video in a browser through a Flask app

ðŸ§° Tech Stack
Apache Kafka: Streaming backbone
Python: Language of choice
Kafka-Python: Kafka client for Python
OpenCV: For reading and encoding video frames
Flask: Web server for serving frames
